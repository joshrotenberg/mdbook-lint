# Chapter 1

This is the first chapter of our test book.

## Section 1.1

Some content here with proper formatting.

```rust
fn example() {
    println!("This code has a proper language tag");
}
```

## Section 1.2

More content to test with.

- Properly formatted list
- With consistent markers
- And good spacing

This chapter should be clean and pass all linting rules.
