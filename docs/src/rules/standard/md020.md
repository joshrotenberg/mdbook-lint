# MD020 - No Space Inside Hashes on Closed ATX Style Heading

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Headings  
**Auto-fix**: ✓ Available

## Rule Description

This rule ensures closed ATX-style headings have no spaces inside the closing hashes. Closed ATX headings use trailing hash characters for symmetry, and spaces inside these markers are incorrect.

## Why This Rule Exists

Proper closed heading format is important because:
- Follows the ATX heading specification
- Maintains consistent heading style
- Prevents parsing issues with some markdown processors
- Ensures visual symmetry in closed headings

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect (violates rule)

```markdown
# Heading with space before closing #
## Another heading ##  
### Heading with spaces ### 
```

### ✅ Correct

```markdown
# Heading with proper closing #
## Another heading ##
### Correctly closed heading ###
# Open heading is also fine
```

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Automatic Fix

This rule supports automatic fixing with `--fix`. The fix will:
- Remove spaces between heading content and closing hashes
- Preserve the heading level and content
- Maintain the closed heading style

### Apply Fix

```bash
# Fix closed heading spacing
mdbook-lint lint --fix docs/

# Preview what would be fixed
mdbook-lint lint --fix --dry-run docs/
```

## When to Disable

Consider disabling this rule if:
- You prefer open ATX headings (without closing hashes)
- Your markdown processor has different requirements for closed headings

### Disable in Config

```toml
# .mdbook-lint.toml
disabled_rules = ["MD020"]
```

### Disable Inline

```markdown
<!-- mdbook-lint-disable MD020 -->
# Heading with space # 
<!-- mdbook-lint-enable MD020 -->
```
