# MD018 - No Space After Hash on ATX Style Heading

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Headings  
**Auto-fix**: ✓ Available

## Rule Description

This rule ensures there's a space after the hash character(s) in ATX-style headings. The space improves readability and is required by many markdown parsers.

## Why This Rule Exists

A space after the hash is important because:
- Many markdown parsers require it for proper heading recognition
- Improves readability and consistency
- Follows CommonMark specification
- Prevents confusion with other hash-prefixed content

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect (violates rule)

```markdown
#Heading without space
##Another heading missing space
###Third level also needs space
```

### ✅ Correct

```markdown
# Heading with proper space
## Another heading correctly formatted
### Third level with space
```

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Automatic Fix

This rule supports automatic fixing with `--fix`. The fix will:
- Add a single space after the hash character(s)
- Preserve the heading level and content
- Handle all heading levels (1-6)

### Apply Fix

```bash
# Fix heading spacing issues
mdbook-lint lint --fix docs/

# Preview what would be fixed
mdbook-lint lint --fix --dry-run docs/
```

## When to Disable

Consider disabling this rule if:
- You're working with a non-standard markdown parser that doesn't require spaces
- Your content includes hash-prefixed text that isn't meant to be headings

### Disable in Config

```toml
# .mdbook-lint.toml
disabled_rules = ["MD018"]
```

### Disable Inline

```markdown
<!-- mdbook-lint-disable MD018 -->
#NoSpaceHeading
<!-- mdbook-lint-enable MD018 -->
```
