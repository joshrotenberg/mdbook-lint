## Overview

Emphasis rules ensure consistent formatting of bold (`**text**`) and italic
(`*text*`) text throughout your documents.

### Common Issues

- Using `**bold**` on a line by itself as a pseudo-heading
- Spaces inside markers like `**bold**` that may not render

- Mixing asterisks and underscores inconsistently

### Best Practices

- Use real headings (`##`) instead of bold text for sections
- Keep emphasis markers tight against text (no internal spaces)
- Choose one style (asterisks or underscores) and use it consistently
