# Chapter 2

This is a simple second chapter to complete the book structure.

## Basic Content

Some basic content here that should be mostly clean.

```rust
fn example_function() {
    println!("This has proper language tagging");
}
```

## A Few Minor Issues

This line might be a bit long but should be under the limit for most configurations.

```
# This code block lacks a language tag - MDBOOK001 violation
echo "Should trigger a violation"
```

## Normal Section

Regular content that follows good practices.

- Properly formatted list
- With consistent bullet points
- And appropriate spacing

That should be sufficient for testing purposes.
